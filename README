## Compiling the jars for the Cluster
To perform this step, you must have a running Dataproc cluster on the Google cloud, and must also have the required 
Hadoop jar files in some directory accessible to the current working directory. The path to this directory will be 
referred to in the following instructions as `[JAR_PATH]`.

### Compiling InvertedIndex
This jar is responsible for constructing the Inverted Indices on the cluster
To compile and package:

1. `cd InvertedIndecies`
1. `javac --release 8 -cp "[JAR_PATH]" InvertedIndex.java`
1. `jar cf ii.jar InvertedIndex*.class`

The jar `ii.jar` must then be uploaded to the GCP cluster, and will be referenced in job request by FleckSearch

### Compiling TopN
This jar is responsible for determine the Top N most common words, where N is a number specified by the user
To compile and package:

1. `cd TopN`
1. `javac --release 8 -cp "[JAR_PATH]" TopN.java`
1. `jar cf tn.jar TopN*.class`

The jar `tn.jar` must then be uploaded to the GCP cluster, and will be referenced in job request by FleckSearch
